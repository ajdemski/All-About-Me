              <p>If you want to know more about my personal life I am a 21 year old junior developer who loves to code and wants to make a living out of it and hope to eventually work remotely and travel the world! Before I started Epicodus I had 0 coding experience and it was very difficult and different. Writing code and reading it and understanding it is completely different and both require a lot of practice to master. Im from Oregon and I have a golden retreiver named Marlee. I used to work with my dad and help out with his construction and remodeling business for awhile until I wanted to find something else to do. Im very excited I started to code its changed my life completely.</p>
